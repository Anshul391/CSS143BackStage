## (30pt) Dutch Sort
Sort an array that contains three colors red, white or blue in-place such that the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order of red, yellow and green. Integers 0, 1, and 2 are used to represent the color red, yello, and green respectively. 

Any sorting function from any library is not allowed or you'll receive zero points

For example:

- Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
- Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
