## (25pt) Color Sort
Sort an array that contains three colors red, white or blue in-place such that the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order of red, yellow and green. Integers 0, 1, and 2 are used to represent the color red, yello, and green respectively. 

Any sorting function from any library is not allowed or you'll receive zero points

A few examples:

- Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0], Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
- Input: [1,1,1,2,1,0], Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
- Input: [1,0,2,0,2], Output: [0,0,1,2,2]

The solution can only make up to two passes through the array. That means you can only go through the entire array no more than 2 times.
