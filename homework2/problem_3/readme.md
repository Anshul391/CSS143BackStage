## (35pt) Min Stack

Design a special kind of stack that acts like a regular stack with push, pop, peek, and an additional special function that ***retrieves the minimum element in constant time***. 

The MinStack class is based on your ArrayStack class from problem 2:

```Java
public class MinStack extends ArrayStack {

    public MinStack(int size) {
        super(size);
    }

    public StackElement getMin() {
        // homework
        return null; // placeholder
    }
}
```

*getMin()* is the function that you need to complete.
