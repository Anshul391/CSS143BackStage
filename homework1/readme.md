The homework is in **CSS143B/homework/homework1/**. There are 3 problems in this homework.

* Finish the following tasks:

1. (25pt) Binary Search

Write a function to perform binary search in a **sorted** integer array.

Binary search was discussed in class as part of the search problem. If you need help, [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/) is a good start. Note that binary search can be implemented with or without recursion. If you are comfortable with recursion already, feel free to use it. Otherwise for-loop would do just fine.

A basic code structure is provided at homework1/problem_1/src/Main.java. This file must be used and no change can be made to the main function (line 7, 8 and 9).
